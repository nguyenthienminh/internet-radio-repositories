# Internet Radio Repositories
The repository for the website that contains Internet Radio links. Long story.

Also, if you want to play the radio links, use a application that supports the HLS, HTTP and DASH streaming protocols (like Safari (for HLS), ffplay or VLC).

**Note**: Links are not directly inside repository; it's in the website contents. Don't be lazy.
